# Hello-World
Hi! I'm currently working as a Digital Transformation Analyst and my role is to close the gap between stakeholders in software developments.
I realized that I need to be familiar with software development concepts to work better, so I started taking basic courses in software development and programming,
and I realized how I liked what I was learning and want to learn more.
